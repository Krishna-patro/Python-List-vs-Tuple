# Python List vs. Tuple: A Technical Comparison

This project provides a clear, code-based explanation of the fundamental differences between Python lists and tuples. It demonstrates **mutability** as the core distinction, showing how lists can be modified in place while tuples cannot. This is an essential concept for any Python developer.

## Features
- Demonstrates list mutability (adding, removing, and changing elements).
- Shows how tuples are immutable, resulting in a `TypeError` or `AttributeError`.

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal:
